# 🔢 Math Refresher for AI 

---

### Basic Operations

* `+` add, `-` subtract, `*` multiply, `/` divide.
  Think calculator basics.

---

### Algebra Symbols

* **Subscript (xₜ):** means “x at time t” (like frame t in a video).
* **Superscript (x²):** means “power/exponent” (x \* x).
* **Norm (‖v‖):** fancy word for “length of a vector.”

  * L2 (Euclidean): straight-line distance.
  * L1 (Manhattan): city block distance.
  * L∞: biggest single step in any direction.
* **Σ (Summation):** add a bunch of terms in sequence.

---

### Logs & Exponentials

* **log₂(x):** “how many times 2 multiplies to get x.” (log₂(8) = 3). Used in info theory.
* **ln(x):** log with base *e* (Euler’s number). Handy in probability & growth models.
* **eˣ:** exponential growth/decay.
* **2ˣ:** binary exponential (useful in comp sci & info theory).

---

### Matrices & Vectors

* **Matrix \* Vector:** transforms the vector (common in neural nets).
* **Matrix \* Matrix:** chains transformations.
* **Transpose (Aᵀ):** flip rows ↔ columns.
* **Inverse (A⁻¹):** undo the transformation (if it exists).
* **Determinant (det(A)):** single number that says if matrix is invertible; relates to volume/area scaling.
* **Trace (tr(A)):** sum of main diagonal.

---

### Sets

* **Cardinality |S|:** how many items in set S.
* **Union (A ∪ B):** everything in A or B.
* **Intersection (A ∩ B):** common items.
* **Complement (Aᶜ):** everything *not* in A.

---

### Comparison Operators

* ≥, ≤, ==, != → same as in code.

---

### Eigen Stuff (linear algebra magic)

* **Eigenvalue (λ):** how much a vector stretches.
* **Eigenvector:** direction that stays the same after transformation (just scaled).
  Used in PCA (dimensionality reduction).

---

### Functions & Operators

* **max/min:** biggest/smallest value.
* **1/x:** reciprocal, inverse value.
* **… (ellipsis):** “and so on” in math notation.

---

### Probability Basics

* **f(x):** function notation, “apply rule f to x.”
* **P(x | y):** probability of x given y (conditional probability).
* **E\[X]:** expectation = average value over many tries.
* **Var(X):** variance = how spread out values are.
* **σ(X):** standard deviation = typical amount values wiggle.
* **Cov(X, Y):** how two variables move together.
* **ρ(X, Y):** correlation (covariance normalized), range -1 to 1.

---

👉 **Memory hook:**

* Norm = “length”
* Σ = “sum”
* log = “how many multiplications to reach x”
* Eigen = “stretch & direction magic”
* Variance/σ = “how spread out”
* Cov/ρ = “do they wiggle together?”
