# 🤖 Fundamentals of AI

### AI vs ML vs DL (the Russian doll model)

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Big umbrella. Goal: make machines act smart (language, vision, problem-solving).
* **Machine Learning (ML):** Subset of AI. Machines *learn from data* instead of being hardcoded.
* **Deep Learning (DL):** Subset of ML. Uses many-layered neural nets (deep = stacked layers) to find patterns in messy data like pictures, sound, or text.

Visualize it as concentric circles:
**AI > ML > Neural Nets > Deep Learning**

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

* Focus: simulate human smarts (reasoning, perception, decision-making).
* Fields inside AI:

  * **NLP:** teach machines language.
  * **Computer Vision:** teach machines to “see.”
  * **Robotics:** moving + acting.
  * **Expert Systems:** mimic experts’ decisions.
* Examples:

  * Healthcare: diagnose disease, find drugs.
  * Finance: fraud detection, investment strategies.
  * Cybersecurity: detect & stop threats.
* Goal: **augment humans**, not just replace them.

### Machine Learning (ML)

* Core idea: machines learn patterns from data and improve over time.
* Three flavors:

  * **Supervised learning:** train with labels (cats vs dogs).
  * **Unsupervised learning:** no labels, find hidden patterns (grouping customers).
  * **Reinforcement learning:** trial & error, rewards/penalties (games, robots, self-driving cars).
* Used in: healthcare (diagnosis), finance (fraud), marketing (ads), cybersecurity (threat detection), transportation (traffic + routes).

### Deep Learning (DL)

* Uses **deep neural nets** (lots of layers).
* Strength: extracts complex patterns automatically.
* Key traits:

  * **Hierarchical learning:** early layers find simple stuff (edges); later layers find complex stuff (faces).
  * **End-to-end:** raw data → result, no manual feature engineering.
  * **Scales well:** eats big data + GPUs.
* Main neural net flavors:

  * **CNNs:** images & video.
  * **RNNs:** sequential data (text, speech).
  * **Transformers:** language tasks, use self-attention for long-range word relations.
* Domains DL revolutionized: vision, NLP, speech, reinforcement learning (like AlphaGo).

### Relationship

* **AI is the goal.**
* **ML is the method.**
* **DL is the turbocharged version of ML.**
* Together, they power stuff like:

  * Self-driving cars (ML + DL + sensors).
  * Robotics (reinforcement learning + DL).
  * Chatbots & translation (ML + Transformers).

👉 **Cheat Memory Hook:**
AI = “Be smart”
ML = “Learn patterns”
DL = “Do it with giant neural nets”
