PoC — XSS payload encapsulation

Goal: Demonstrate that the application applies a capitalization-based encoding/normalization and double quote (") encapsulation.

Observed: Screenshot shows the HTML source containing " <STYLE>BODY{FILTER:INVERT(1) !IMPORTANT}</STYLE> " and the rendered page behavior (screenshot). This proves that script tags can persist through storage/display.

Payload (PoC):

bc. POST BODY
 <STYLE>BODY{FILTER:INVERT(1) !IMPORTANT}</STYLE>
