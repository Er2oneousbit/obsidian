| **Server Type**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `DNS Root Server`              | The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe. |
| `Authoritative Nameserver`     | Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Non-authoritative Nameserver` | Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Caching DNS Server`           | Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Forwarding Server`            | Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Resolver`                     | Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |


| **Attribute**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Resource Record`            | A domain name, usually a fully qualified domain name, is the first part of a Resource Record. If you don't use a fully qualified domain name, the zone's name where the record is located will be appended to the end of the name.                                     |
| `TTL`                        | In seconds, the Time-To-Live (`TTL`) defaults to the minimum value specified in the SOA record.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Record Class`               | Internet, Hesiod, or Chaos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Start Of Authority` (`SOA`) | It should be first in a zone file because it indicates the start of a zone. Each zone can only have one `SOA` record, and additionally, it contains the zone's values, such as a serial number and multiple expiration timeouts.                                       |
| `Name Servers` (`NS`)        | The distributed database is bound together by `NS` Records. They are in charge of a zone's authoritative name server and the authority for a child zone to a name server.                                                                                              |
| `IPv4 Addresses` (`A`)       | The A record is only a mapping between a hostname and an IP address. 'Forward' zones are those with `A` records.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Pointer` (`PTR`)            | The PTR record is a mapping between an IP address and a hostname. 'Reverse' zones are those that have `PTR` records.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Canonical Name` (`CNAME`)   | An alias hostname is mapped to an `A` record hostname using the `CNAME` record.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Mail Exchange` (`MX`)       | The `MX` record identifies a host that will accept emails for a specific host. A priority value has been assigned to the specified host. Multiple MX records can exist on the same host, and a prioritized list is made consisting of the records for a specific host. |

| `A`            | Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `AAAA`         | Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `MX`           | Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `NS`           | Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TXT`          | This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam. |
| `CNAME`        | This record serves as an alias. If the domain www.hackthebox.eu should point to the same IP, and we create an A record for one and a CNAME record for the other.                                                                                  |
| `PTR`          | The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.                                                                                                                                     |
| `SOA`          | Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.                                                                                                                                            |
