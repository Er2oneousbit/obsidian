| `NFSv2`     | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `NFSv3`     | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                                                                                                                                       |
| `NFSv4`     | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |

| `rw`               | Read and write permissions.                                                                                                                 |
| `ro`               | Read only permissions.                                                                                                                      |
| `sync`             | Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)                                                                                                   |
| `async`            | Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)                                                                                                  |
| `secure`           | Ports above 1024 will not be used.                                                                                                          |
| `insecure`         | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                                              |
| `no_subtree_check` | This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.                                                                                    |
| `root_squash`      | Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents `root` from accessing files on an NFS mount. |
|                    |                                                                                                                                             |
